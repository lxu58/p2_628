Title: Bubble

Description: A bubble reflects the sunshine!! 
Reference IMG: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bubble#/media/File:Reflection_in_a_soap_bubble_edit.jpg


Randomness: Size of bubble, the leaves (two types: one leaf 10 of them, three leaves 2 of them), the color of background would change when click [reroll]

Main Pattern & Reactivity: Treat mouse position as where the sun is. The reflection on the bubble will rotate based on where your mouse is.


Statement: entirely new to p5.js. I really want to do a lot of things, for example, let the leaves generate in a specific way so it won't be too random, but the technical issues take me way too long to solve. I remove the part that I want to make bubble movable, and make seed random to keep leaves position when the loops are being called .
